# ISSUES
- Deals not crediting
- Deals being credited to the wrong levels
- Flot out denied credit for deals despite having ample proof
- Deals disappearing
- Member support taking forever to respond
- Member support not responding at all
- Blaming users for issues that are clearly within their own system given the volume of people with the same exact complaints


# PERTINENT INFORMATION
- I have been keeping a detailed log of all the deals I’ve completed (mainly to keep track of any billing issues but also just to keep a tab of what I’ve done versus what I’ve recieved credit for)
	- This log contains the deal names, dates completed, what date I would have to cancel the subscription by in order to not be charged, how much money was initially spent on each deal, what level the deals were completed on, whether or not they were credited automatically, what level they were credited to if they were credited automatically, and verification of deal completion in the form of .PNG screenshots or .PDF documents of the confirmation emails recieved.
- I also have every single email relayed back and forth over this entire process.

Conveniently for them, I ran into this trouble right as I was ONE deal away from being able to claim the $750 reward. It took three emails and just shy of two weeks to recieve a response and by that time, deals that had already been credited began expiring and disappearing from my account. So, afraid that I would continue to lose deals and with the knowledge that any deals that I did complete at this point would take way too long to actually receive credit for (during which time I would only continue to lose credit for more and more deals that I had already done), I decided to cut my losses and just claim the $500 reward. However, when I went to claim it, I got a popup message saying that I had already claimed a reward within the last year - which is utterly false. This is my first time ever attempting this program. I’ve never had an account with this program in the past and I had never even heard of it before the day I initially signed up. I sent a message to member support and it took
