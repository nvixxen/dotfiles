Let **night blossom** *beta\** bring the brightness of Spring to your editor. It is designed to be easy on the eyes as the daylight hours fade and you sit back, with lo-fi tracks in the background, getting stuck into bringing life to your projects.

\*night blossom is currently in beta. This means that although the colour palette won't change, while better support for different languages is added, the specific token to colour mappings may change.

### Example

### Semantic Tokens

This colour theme is designed to take advantage of `Semantic Highlighting` in VSCode. To enable this, follow the instructions below:

1. Navigate to the VSCode's settings (`Ctrl + ,` on Windows, `Cmd + ,` on macOS).
2. Search for `Semantic Highlighting` (or navigate to: `Editor › Semantic Highlighting`).
3. Select `true`.

As the project is in it's early stages, I hope to hear your feedback! I would love to improve this theme, be it better support for languages, or colour optimisations that make it easier to use.

Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any suggestions, raise an issue, or create a PR!

I look forward to hearing from you (:
